# memory-game
A console program made in C++ that tests a player's memory. Once started, the game will display a picture of text art to you. That picture will disappear after three seconds. Once it disappears, you must enter the picture you just saw. If you guess correctly, you move onto the next level. Otherwise, you will be asked if you want to play again. A 'Yes' will start the game again, and a 'No' will quit the program.

To run the program, download the file and run it in whatever IDE or shell you desire.  

It is essential that you view this in a fully maximized console app.
------------------------------------------------------------------ 

I formatted much of the game to appear in the middle of the screen using tabs and spaces, so the text will appear misplaced based on the size of your console app's window. 

If you have any feedback or notice a bug, feel free to contact me at jenkinsb1@spu.edu. If you want to contibute, feel free to create a pull request. Just make sure your code it aligns with the content and nature of the memory game itself.

Have fun!
